# Software Cost Estimation

This assignment introduced the idea of genetic programming, which is "used to discover solutions to problems humans do not know how to solve, directly"<sup>[1](http://geneticprogramming.com/)</sup>.

Cost estimation in software engineering is one such problem. I used [DEAP](https://deap.readthedocs.io/) and some data sets from the [PROMISE Software Engineering Repository](promise.site.uottawa.ca/SERepository/) to explore how to solve it in Python.

As usual, you can read about it in the report,[report.pdf](https://github.com/tiggerdine/software-cost-estimation/blob/master/report.pdf).
